<h1>Novelty and Conservatism</h1>

<p>The rapid urbanization and industrialization of western Europe and the United States in the later nineteenth century&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the emergence of a <span class="italic">literate urbanized mass market</span>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;pulled typography out of the elite world of the book, and into the public eye. The saturation of visual culture with type, something we now take for granted, was a product of this time. Handbills, posters, advertisements, letterheads, printed packaging, produced in huge quantities by commercial jobbing presses, papered the new industrial landscape with type. Typography voraciously assimilated and innovated, producing extruded, textured, ornamented letters and compositions exploding with flourishes, ornate borders, and elaborate color treatments. This exuberance was a symptom of Victorian society&rsquo;s uneasy relationship to technology.&sup1;</p>

<p>At the start of the nineteenth century, London was at the center of typographic developments. Competition between the foundries of William Caslon IV, Vincent Figgins and Robert Thorne to answer the need for bigger and bolder type produced several stylistic innovations that set the stage for the technology-driven type design explosion of the latter half of the century. In 1803, Robert Thorne introduced the &lsquo;fat face,&rsquo; a roman (originally Didot) letterform with very exaggerated contrast. The first &lsquo;Antique&rsquo; or &lsquo;Egyptian&rsquo; appeared in 1816 on a Figgins specimen sheet, to be refined and patented by William H. Thorowgood as Clarendon in 1845. Meanwhile, the &lsquo;Doric,&rsquo; an Antique without serifs, made its debut at the base of a Caslon specimen sheet in 1815. By 1832, the style had acquired a lower case and was being referred to by its present day name, sans-serif (though it continued to go by &lsquo;grotesque&rsquo; in Germany and &lsquo;gothic&rsquo; in the United States). By the 1840s, all of these styles were co-mingling, with the characteristic eclecticism of the age, in the printed ephemera of industrial society.</p>
